UT001,Is there a distinct category of dual for verbal agreement with a dual subject?,0,Riese et al. 2019:198,,
UT002,Is non-agreement in number between the nominal subject and verbal predicate possible?,1,Riese et al. 2019:57,UT002,"“On occasion, a grammatically singular noun that refers to a group of sorts (e.g., калык [kɑlək] ‘people’, кӱтӱ [kyty] ‘herd’, еш [jeʃ] ‘family’), or pair nouns/collective nouns [...], co-occur with plural forms of verbs. In these cases, singular verbal forms are however also possible, and recommended by prescriptive grammarians.”"

UT008,Can non-finite clauses use a special means for core argument (S/A) marking?,1,Riese et al. 2019:254,UT008,"“The gerunds in -мек(е) [-mek(e)] and -меш(ке) [-meʃ(ke)] take possessive suffixes; their agent, which can (but does not have to) differ from the agent of the superordinate (often finite) verb, can be marked by a preceding pronoun or noun. If the agent of the gerundial action is a noun, it can be in the nominative or the genitive. Inanimate nouns generally occur in the nominative, while animate nouns occur in either the nominative or genitive. When used with a genitive form, the gerund usually has a possessive suffix third person.” (Riese et al. 2019:254) The same applies to participles (EG 261, 265, 266); the picture is more complicated with postpositions (Riese et al. 2019:160) where the government depends on the individual postposition."
