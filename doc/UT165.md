**Is there radical qualitative consonant gradation?**

Radical qualitative consonant gradation is an alternation in consonants that depends on the (historical) openness or closeness of the second syllable. When the second syllable is closed, the consonant at the boundary of the first and second syllable is weakened, lost, or replaced by a “weak” counterpart.
