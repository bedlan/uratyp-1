**Can tense be expressed overtly in the negative marker?**

Languages that allow grammatical categories to occur on the negative marker (usually called *negative auxiliary*) differ as to which grammatical categories can be expressed on the negative auxiliary and which on the lexical verb (cf. also UT022). The aim of this question is to find out whether tense can be expressed on the negative marker, as in South Saami (cf. 1a and 1b).

>(1) South Saami<br/>
>a. ***Im** lohkh*<br/>
>NEG.1SG read.CNG<br/>
>‘I do not read’

>b. ***Idtjim*** lohkh*<br/>
>NEG.PST.1SG read.CNG<br/>
>‘I did not read’

**Coding.** The value is '1' if tense can be overtly expressed on the negative marker. If no such marking is possible, the value is '0'.
