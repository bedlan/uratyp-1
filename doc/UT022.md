**Can aspect be expressed overtly on the negative marker?**

Languages that allow grammatical categories to occur on the negative marker (typically called *negative auxiliary*) differ as to which grammatical categories can be expressed on the negative auxiliary and which on the lexical verb. This question investigates, whether aspect can occur on the negative marker. For instance, in Nganasan, the iterative suffix *-kǝ* and habitual suffix *-muŋha* (both derivational) appear on the negative auxiliary (Gusev 2015: 107).

**Coding.** The value is '1' if aspect can be expressed overtly on the negative marker. The value is '0' if such marking is not possible.
