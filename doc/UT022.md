**Can aspect be expressed overtly in the negative marker?**

Languages that allow grammatical categories to occur in the negative marker (typically called the *negative auxiliary*) differ as to which grammatical categories can be expressed in the negative auxiliary and which in the lexical verb. This question investigates whether aspect can occur in the negative marker. For instance, in Nganasan, the iterative suffix *-kǝ* and habitual suffix *-muŋha* (both derivational) appear in the negative auxiliary (Gusev 2015: 107).

>munu-gǝ-tu  vs.  ńi-gǝ-ti̮ munǝ-ˀ<br/>
>say-ITER-PRS.3SG vs. NEG-ITER-PRS.3SG say-CNG<br/>
>'(S)he regularly says' vs. '(S)he doesn't (regularly) say'

**Coding.** The value is '1' if aspect can be expressed overtly in the negative marker. The value is '0' if such marking is not possible.
