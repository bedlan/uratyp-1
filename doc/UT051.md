**Can non-finite dependent clauses use the standard negation construction?**

This question investigates whether the standard negation construction can also be used in non-finite dependent clauses. For instance in Hungarian, the negative marker *nem* can be used in both contexts (see 1a and 1b). 

>(1) Hungarian<br/>
>a. ***Nem** lát-va a kutyá-t, megbotl-ott*<br/>
>NEG see-PTCP DEF dog-ACC trip.over-PST.3SG<br/> 
>'As he did not see the dog, he tripped over'<br/>

>b. ***Nem** lát-ta meg a kutyá-t és megbotl-ott*<br/>
>NEG see-PST.3SG PRV DEF dog and trip.over-PST.3SG<br/>
>'He did not see the dog and tripped over'<br/>

To compare, the Estonian particle *ei* that appears in standard negation construction is not compatible with non-finite dependent clauses and *mitte* has to be used instead (see UT052). 

**Coding.** The value is '1' if standard negation construction can also be used in non-finite dependent clauses (as in Hungarian). The answer is '0' if non-finite dependent clauses make use of a different negative marker or an entirely different negation construction is employed.
