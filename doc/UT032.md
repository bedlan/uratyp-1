**Is there morphological marking on the verb used to direct commands/wishes, etc. to the 1Sg?**

In addition to commands addressed to a singular 2nd person it is also possible to direct commands to other persons (see also UT031). This question asks whether a non-indicative morphological marking can be used on the verb to direct a command/wish, etc. to the singular 1st person, as in example (1). (The corresponding form is usually called a *jussive*, *optative*, *imperative* or *hortative*.)

>‘S/he suggested that I should go ahead’ 

**Coding.** The value is '1' if a morphological marking can be used on the verb to direct a command/wish, etc. to a singular 1st person. If there is no such marking or this function is encoded only by a particle the value is '0'.
