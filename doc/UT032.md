**Is there morphological marking on the verb used to express indirect commands/wishes etc. directed to the 1Sg?**

In addition to commands addressed to a singular 2nd person it is also possible to direct commands to other persons (see also UT031). This question asks whether there is a dedicated morphological marking on the verb to express a command, wish or the like directed to a singular 1st person, as in example (1). (The respective forms are usually called *jussive*, *optative*, *imperative* or *hortative*.)

**Codig.** The value is '1' if a dedicated morphological marking can be used on the verb to direct a command, wish or the like to a singular 1st person. If there is no such marking (e.g., this function is encoded by a particle) the value is '0'.
