**Is it possible to use the singular with the paired body parts/clothing/accessories that accompany them?**

A noun can appear in the singular to denote paired body parts (1) or clothing/accessories that accompany them (2). This may be true even for languages with a dual number. To denote one member of the pair, the word for ‘half’ is typically used.

(1) Udmurt<br/>
>*син*<br/>
>ɕin<br/>
>eye.NOM.SG<br/>
>'eyes'

(2) Hungarian<br/>
>*Koszos a **cipő***<br/>
>dirty.NOM.SG DEF.ART shoe.NOM.SG<br/>
>‘The shoes are dirty’<br/>

**Coding.** The answer is '1' if in at least one of the instances (paired body parts/clothing/accessories) it is possible to use a singular form (examples 1-2). The answer is '0' if there are no such instances or the singular form can only be associated with lexicalized forms, adverbial or postpositional usages. For instance, *jalas* in the Estonian example (3) could be analyzed as an adverbial.

>*Kingad on **jalas***<br/>
>kinga-d on jalas<br/>
>shoe-PL  be.3SG jalg.INE<br/>
>‘I have shoes on, I am wearing shoes’ (Lit. ‘Shoes are in my leg’)
