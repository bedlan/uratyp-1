**Is there fixed primary stress?**

Fixed primary stress means that the stress is always in the same position in a word. The primary stress can be fixed on the first syllable even if non-initial syllables comprise long vowels (see Finnish example). The primary stress may also be fixed on the last syllable of a word (as in Udmurt), or on any other position.

>kiveen /ˈki.veːn/ stone.ILL.SG

>Udmurt<br/>
>курыт /ku.ˈrɯt/ ‘bitter’

**Coding.** The value is '1' if the primary stress is fixed in a language.
