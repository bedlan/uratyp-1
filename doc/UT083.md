**Is there a terminative case?**

The terminative case is typically used to express up to which point in space (1a) or time (1b) an action takes place. 

(1) Hungarian<br/>
>a. *pályaudvar-**ig***<br/>
>railway_station-TERM<br/>
>‘until the railway station’<br/>

>b. *péntek-**ig***<br/>
>Friday-TERM<br/>
>’until Friday’<br/>

To compare, in Finnish a directional case followed by an adposition has to be used to convey the respective meanings (2), and thus Finnish is coded as '0'.

(2) Finnish<br/>
>*koti-in asti*<br/>
>home-ILL until<br/>
>'until home'<br/>

**Coding.** The value is '1' if there is a separate case to express a limit in space or time as in Hungarian. If this can be regarded as a secondary function of some other case or the respective meaning is conveyed by an adpositional construction (as in Finnish), the value is '0'.
