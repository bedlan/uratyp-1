**Is there a bound superlative degree marker on property words?**

This question asks whether there is a bound marker of superlative degree on property words, as in the Finnish example (1). Property words roughly correspond to adjectives.

(1) Finnish<br/> 
>*kaunis : **kaunein***<br/> 
>kaunis : kaune-in<br/> 
>beautiful : beautiful-SUPL<br/> 
>‘beautiful' : 'the most beautiful’

To compare, in Erzya, the corresponding constructions are formed by using *veśe* 'all' in the ablative case followed by an adjective in the nominative case (Aasmäe 2012). Thus, Erzya is coded as '0'.

**Coding.** The answer is '1' if a language has a morphological marking available to express the highest quality/degree (as in Finnish). The answer is '0' if there is no bound marker available (as in Erzya).
