**Is the singular form of the noun also used with numerals bigger than 1?**

It is common for the word meaning ‘1’ to assign singular number to its sister noun, whereas with words expressing higher values plural number (or dual) can be expected (cross-lingistically this applies at least to numbers up to '10') (Hurford 2003: 582). However, there are also languages that can assign singular number to all its sister nouns. This applies, for instance, to Komi-Zyrian (1) and Finnish (2). Although in Finnish numerals bigger than 1 trigger a different case (partitive), the number is still singular. 

(1) Komi-Zyrian<br/>
>*öти **небöг** : куим **небöг***<br/>
>*ɘci ɲebɘg : kuim ɲebɘg*<br/>
>one.NOM.SG book.NOM.SG : three.NOM.SG book.NOM.SG<br/>
>'one book' : 'three books'

(2) Finnish<br/>
>*yksi **ystävä** :  kaksi **ystävää***<br/> 
>one.NOM.SG friend.NOM.SG :  two.NOM.SG friend.PRT.SG<br/>
>‘one friend' : 'two friends’

**Coding.** The value is '1' if the noun can appear in the singular form also with numerals bigger than '1' (as in Komi-Zyrian example), regardless of case marking (see Finnish example). In case there is a separate marking for numeral '2' but otherwise singular is used, the value is still '1'. The value is '0' if singular marking is not commonly used with numerals bigger than '1'.
