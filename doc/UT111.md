**Are case and number marked cumulatively across the paradigm?**

This question examines whether it is possible that case and number affixes cannot be segmented, i.e., they are coded by cumulative formatives (see veennset in example 1). Here, we are interested in cases where cumulative marking applies across the entire case paradigm of a language. Such markers may also be referred to as *portmanteau morphemes*.

Whereas in Kildin Saami number and case are expressed by portmanteau suffixes (see Rieẞler 2022:231), in Estonian, cumulative marking occurs with certain words and in some parts of the paradigm (cf. 2a-b). Thus, Estonian is coded as ‘0’ for this feature.

>‘mountains’<br/>

>b. *mägedel*<br/> 
>mäge-de-l<br/>
>mountain-PL-ADE<br/>
>‘on the mountains’<br/>

**Coding.** The value is '1', if case and number can be marked cumulatively across the entire case paradigm. If cumulative marking is possible only in some parts of the paradigm, the value is ‘0’.
