**Can non-finite clauses use a special means for core argument (P) marking?**



**Non-finite clauses can differ from finite clauses in terms of core argument marking. For a special way of S/A marking with non-finite clauses, see UT008.**



**\*\*Coding.\*\* The value is '1' if the P argument of the non-finite clause is encoded by a case that is not commonly used to encode the respective argument in the finite clause.**
