**Are there nonfinite forms that can be used both as participles and converbs without any additional morphological material, such as case markers?**

Nonfinite forms can be used in various functions, including as converbs. A converb can be defined as "a nonfinite verb form whose main function is to mark adverbial subordination"; whereas converbs could be seen as verbal adverbs, participles could be regarded as verbal adjectives (Haspelmath 2020: 3). This question asks whether one and the same form can be used in both functions. (Converbs may be subsumed under different labels, e.g., in Udmurt they are typically called gerunds.)

>'S/he spoke comprehensibly'<br/> 

**Coding.** The value is '1' if there is a nonfinite form that can function both as a participle and as a converb without any additional morphological material.
