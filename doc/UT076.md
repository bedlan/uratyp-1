**Are there adpositions that show a tripartite system?**

Adpositions with the same stem may encode a three-way distinction, i.e., express a distinction between goal (also called *destination of movement*), location, and source of movement (for case marking, see also UT091 and UT092). As conflation in systems of spatial adpositions is relatively common (especially of location and destination marking; see, e.g., Creissels 2012), this question only targets instances that reveal a tripartite system without there being syncretism, as in examples (1a-c).

Locations that are more commonly marked for direction are AT < IN, ON < UNDER < BEHIND < FRONT (Zwarts 2010: 984).

**Coding.** The answer is '1' if such a three-way distinction as in (1a-c) is possible at least with some adpositions expressing AT, IN/ON, UNDER, BEHIND, FRONT. If no tripartite system can be attested, the answer is '0'.
