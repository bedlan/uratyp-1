**Is there morphological marking on the verb dedicated to the expression of epistemic possibility?** 

Epistemic modality can be defined as the “speaker’s evaluation of the likelihood of a state of affairs” (Nuyts 2001: xv). For instance, *Jane is probably/may be at work* can be analysed as follows: the speaker holds that the proposition "Jane is at work" is not certain but only a mere possibility, relative to what s/he knows or his/her evidence. This question asks whether there is morphological marking available in such instances (see example 1).

>Poruka-n vanh-i-mpa-na hän **puhu-nee** kokemukse-sta*<br/>

>‘As the oldest in the group, he probably speaks from experience’ 

**Coding.** The value is '1' if epistemic possibility can be expressed using a dedicated morphological means. If a language only contains lexical means or phonologically independent means (particles, auxiliaries), the value is '0'.
