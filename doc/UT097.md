**Is there a dedicated case that expresses equativity?**

In equative constructions, two referents can be regarded to have a gradable property to the same degree. Such constructions typically consist of a (i) comparee (see ‘Kim’ in example 1), (ii) a degree-marker (‘as’), (iii) a parameter (‘tall’), (iv) a standard-marker (‘as’), and (v) a standard (‘Pat'); If the standard-marker is a suffix it is possible to speak about an equative case (Haspelmath 2017). For example, in Erzya, although with some reservations, the suffix *-ʃkɑ* is included in the case paradigm (referred to as the comparative). It is used to encode size or the approximate quantity of a referent, as in example (2) (Ajanki and Hamari 2022:399–400).

>(1) *Kim is as tall as Pat* (Haspelmath 2011:19)<br/>

(2) Erzya and Moksha (Ajanki & Hamari, to appear)<br/>
>*алашашка*<br/>
>ɑlɑʃɑ-ʃkɑ<br/>
>horse-CMPR<br/>
>‘as big as a horse’<br/>
>(Ajanki and Hamari 2022:418)

**Coding.** The value is '1', if there is a separate morphological marker to compare two referents with respect to a gradable property (as in Erzya and Moksha). If there is no case marker or it is only possible to use derivational means, the value is ‘0’.
