**Is there morphological marking on the verb dedicated to the expression of desire or wish?**

Desiderative modality expresses a desire, wish or intention of the subject referent to bring about a given state of affairs. For example, Mari has a separate desiderative mood marked by *-ne* (1); there is no verb meaning 'to want' (Riese et al. 238-246). (The term *optative* may also be used.)

>*луд-**не**-м*<br/>
>read-DES-1SG<br/>
>‘I want to/intend to read'

**Coding.** The value is '1' if there is a dedicated marker for the expression of desire or wish. Examples of a conditional mood used in a similar meaning were not considered to count as '1', since the situation is regarded as possible only under certain conditions.
