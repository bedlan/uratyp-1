**Is there a locative case that expresses source?**

A language may contain different local cases for encoding goal, location, and source (see also UT086 and UT087). This question asks whether there is a dedicated case to express source, as in Finnish (1).

(1) Finnish<br/>
>*Tule-n talo-**sta***<br/>
>come-1SG house-ELA<br/>
>‘I come from (inside of) the house.’

**Coding.** The value is '1' if there is at least one such local case that is primarily used to express source. The answer is '0' if there is syncretism, i.e. the same case also expresses location (see UT090).
