**Is there stress in heavy syllables?**

Heavy syllables have the structure VV and VC (i.e., syllables contain a long vowel, diphthong, or end in a consonant). In some languages, such syllables tend to attract word stress (see -таш in Meadow Mari)..

>Meadow Mari<br/>
>кокырыкˈташ /kokərəkˈtɑʃ/ ‘make someone cough’

**Coding.** The value is '1' if heavy syllables tend to attract word stress.
