**Is there a future participle?**

To be regarded as a future participle the respective participle needs to denote an action that will/must/should be carried out or occur in the future. For example, according to Krasnova et al. (2017), the Hill Mari marker *-šašlə̑k* is primarily used for future situations, but it sometimes also appears in debitive contexts.

>*кач-**шашлык** киндӹ*<br/>
>[kɑt͡ʃ-ʃɑʃlək kində̈]<br/>
>eat-PTCP.FUT bread<br/>
>'bread that will/should be eaten'<br/>

**Coding.** The value is '1' if there is a participle that gives rise to a future interpretation (but possibly also appears in some modal contexts). The value is '0' if there is no such participle that can receive future interpretation. Examples where future interpretation rises only from the context or can be associated with a particular construction were not counted.
