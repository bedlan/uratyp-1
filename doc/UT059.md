**Is there a future participle?**

To be regarded as a future participle the coresponding participle needs to denote an action that will/must/should be carried out or occur in the future. For example, according to Krasnova et al. (2017), the Hill Mari marker *-šašlə̑k* is primarily used for future situations, but it sometimes also appears in debitive contexts.

>***качшашлык** киндӹ*<br/>
>kɑt͡ʃ-ʃɑʃlək kində̈<br/>
>eat-PTCP.FUT bread<br/>
>'bread that will/should be eaten'<br/>
>(Krasnova et al. 2017: 162)

**Coding.** The value is '1' if there is a participle that gives rise to a future interpretation (but possibly also appears in some modal contexts). The value is '0' if there is no participle that can receive a future interpretation. Examples where a future interpretation arises only from context or is associated with a particular construction were not counted.
