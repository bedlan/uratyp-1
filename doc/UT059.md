**Is there a future participle?**

To be regarded as a future participle the respective participle needs to denote an action that will/must/should be carried out or occur in the future. Such a participle can be found in Hill Mari (example 1).

(1) Hill Mari (Krasnova et al. 2017: 162)<br/>
>*кач-**шашлык** киндӹ*<br/>
>[kɑt͡ʃ-ʃɑʃlək kində̈]<br/>
>eat-PTCP.FUT bread<br/>
>'bread that will/should be eaten'<br/>

**Coding.** The value is '1' if there is a participle that gives rise to a future interpretation (but possibly also appears in some modal contexts). The value is '0' if there is no such participle or the participle mainly occurs in modal contexts or with present time reference.
