**Is there morphological marking on the verb used to express indirect commands/wishes etc. directed to the 3Sg?**

A command addressed to a singular 2nd person can be regarded as a canonical imperative, but commands can also be addressed to other persons (Aikhenvald 2015: 234). The aim of this question is to find out whether a dedicated morphological marking can be used when expressing a command/wish or the like directed to a singular 3rd person, as in (1) (cf. also UT032). (The respective forms are usually called *jussive*, *optative* or *imperative*.)

>*Hän  tul-**koon** sisään*<br/>
>s/he  come-JUSS.3SG inside<br/>
>‘Let him/her come inside!’

**Coding.** The value is '1' if a dedicated morphological marking (different from the indicative) can appear on the verb to convey a command directed to the singular 3rd person.
