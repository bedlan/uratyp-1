**Is there morphological marking on the verb used to express direct commands/wishes, etc. to the 3Sg?**

A command addressed to a singular 2nd person can be regarded as a canonical imperative, but commands can also be addressed to other persons (Aikhenvald 2015: 234). The aim of this question is to determine whether a non-indicative morphological marking can be used on the verb to direct a command/wish, etc. to the singular 3rd person, as in (1) (cf. also UT032). (The corresponding form is usually called a *jussive*, *optative*, or *imperative*.)

(1) Finnish<br/>
>*Hän  **tulkoon** sisään*<br/>
>hän  tul-koon sisään<br/>
>s/he  come-JUSS.3SG inside<br/>
>‘Let him/her come inside!’

**Coding.** The value is '1' if a morphological marking (different from the indicative) can appear on the verb to convey a command directed to the singular 3rd person. If there is no such marking or this function is encoded only by a particle the value is '0'.
