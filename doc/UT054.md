**Is there an impersonal passive construction?**

A common voice distinction is between active vs. passive. Certain kind of opposition can be, however, better described as a distinction between personal vs. impersonal voice (see also Blevins 2003). Although the communicative function of passive and impersonal may be similar, the respective constructions show differences in their underlying morphosyntax. Whereas the passive is a valency-reducing operation, as a result of impersonalization no constituent is promoted to the subject position (argument realization is constrained) and valency of the verb is preserved, as in (1a). Furthermore, it is also possible to impersonalize intransitive verbs such as ‘to be’, ‘to live’ (1b) etc.

>a. ***Kuula-takse**  muusika-t*<br/>
>listen-IPS.PRS music-PRT<br/>
>‘The music is being listened’<br/>

>b.*Siin **ela-takse** hästi*<br/>
>here live-IPS.PRS well<br/>
>'People live well here’ (lit. ‘It is lived well here’)

**Coding.** The value is '1' if imperzonalization is possible, i.e. the argument structure of the active clause may be retained and/or impersonalization can also involve intransitive verbs.
