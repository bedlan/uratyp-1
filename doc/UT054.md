**Is there an impersonal passive construction?**

A common voice distinction is between active vs. passive. Certain kinds of oppositions, however, can be better described as a distinction between personal vs. impersonal voice (see also Blevins 2003). Although the communicative function of passive and impersonal may be similar, the corresponding constructions show differences in their underlying morphosyntax. Whereas passivization is a valency-reducing operation, as a result of impersonalization, the subject is deleted but no constituent is promoted to the subject position (argument realization is constrained), e.g., in (1a) the object retains its case form (cf. kuula-n muusika-t [listen-1SG music-PRT] ‘I listen to the music’). Impersonalization may involve intransitive verbs such as ‘to be’, ‘to live’ (1b), etc.

>'People live well here’ (lit. ‘It is lived well here’)

**Coding.** The value is '1' if impersonalization is possible, i.e., the argument structure of the active clause may be retained and/or impersonalization can also involve intransitive verbs.
