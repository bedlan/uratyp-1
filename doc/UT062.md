**Are there participles that obligatorily agree with the nouns they modify in case and number (in all contexts)?**

This question asks whether there are participles that obligatorily agree with the nouns they modify in case and number. This is possible, for instance, in Finnish (see example 1). Here, all contexts is used to mean contexts where one would expect agreement also otherwise, e.g., in the case of adnominal modifiers (cf. example 2).

(1) Finnish<br/>
>*Puhuin eilen lähete-**ty-i-stä** kirje-**i-stä***<br/>
>speak-PST-1SG yesterday send-PTCP.PST-PL-ELA letter-PL-ELA<br/>
>‘I was speaking about the letters that were sent yesterday’<br/>

(2) Finnish<br/>
>*uus-**i-sta** kirje-**i-stä***<br/>
>new-PL-ELA letter-PL-ELA<br/>
>'(about) new letters'

**Coding.** The value is '1' if there is at least one such participle, which obligatorily agrees in case and number with the noun it modifies in all contexts.
