**Are there participles that must agree with the nouns they modify in case and number in all contexts?**

This question asks whether there are participles that obligatorily agree with the nouns they modify in case and number. This is possible, for instance, in Finnish (1). 

(1) Finnish<br/>
>*Puhuin eilen **lähetetyistä** kirjeistä*<br/>
>puhuin eilen lähete-ty-i-stä kirje-i-stä<br/>
>speak-PST-1SG yesterday send-PTCP.PST-PL-ELA letter-PL-ELA<br/>
>‘I was speaking about the letters that were sent yesterday’<br/>

Here, "all contexts" is used to mean contexts where one would also expect agreement otherwise, e.g., with adnominal modifiers (cf. example 2).

(2) Finnish<br/>
>***uusista** kirjeistä*<br/>
>uus-i-sta kirje-i-stä<br/>
>new-PL-ELA letter-PL-ELA<br/>
>'(about) new letters'

**Coding.** The value is '1' if there is at least one participle, which obligatorily agrees in case and number with the noun it modifies in all contexts.
