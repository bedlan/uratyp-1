**Do characteristics of object referent (topicality, animacy, definiteness) influence object marking?**

The usage of case marking for some objects and not for other objects is known as differential object marking (DOM). The aim of this question is to find out whether differences in object marking are conditioned by some characteristics (topicality, animacy, or definiteness) of an object. For example, in Komi, definite inanimate objects may be unmarked or not (1a), whereas animate objects obligatorily take the accusative case (1b).

>[*me ʎubit-ɑ Sɨktɨvkɑr-ɘs ~ Sɨktɨvkɑr*]<br/>
>1SG love-PRS.1SG Syktyvkar-ACC ~ Syktyvkar[ACC]<br/>
>‘I like Syktyvkar’

>b. *Ме любита **Бобикöс***<br/>
>[*me ʎubit-ɑ Bobik-ɘs*]<br/>
>1SG love-PRS.1SG Bobik-ACC<br/>
>‘I like Bobik'

Cf. the prominecy scale (Aissen 2003): 
 - Animacy scale: HUMAN > ANIMATE > INANIMATE
 - Definiteness scale: PERSONAL PRONOUN > PROPER NAME > DEFINITE NP > INDEFINITE SPECIFIC NP > NON-SPECIFIC NP
 
**Coding.** The value is '1' if at least one of the above mentioned characteristics of an object referent causes differences in direct object marking. The value is '0' if case marking  depends entirely on the type of a noun (e.g., in Khanty, only pronouns take accusative marking). When answering the question, only finite clauses were considered.
