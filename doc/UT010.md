**Do characteristics of object referent (topicality, animacy, definiteness) influence object marking?**

In languages with overt case-marking of direct objects, the marking may depend on semantic and pragmatic features, a phenomenon known as differential object marking (DOM) (Aissen 2003). This question asks whether differences in object marking are conditioned by certain characteristics of an object, such as topicality, animacy, or definiteness. For example, in Komi, definite inanimate objects may be both unmarked or marked (1a), whereas animate objects obligatorily take the accusative case (1b).

>1SG love-PRS.1SG Syktyvkar-ACC ~ Syktyvkar[ACC]<br/>
>‘I like Syktyvkar’

>b. *Ме любита **Бобикöс***<br/>

>1SG love-PRS.1SG Bobik-ACC<br/>
>‘I like Bobik'

Cf. the prominecy scale (Aissen 2003): 
 - Animacy scale: HUMAN > ANIMATE > INANIMATE
 - Definiteness scale: PERSONAL PRONOUN > PROPER NAME > DEFINITE NP > INDEFINITE SPECIFIC NP > NON-SPECIFIC NP
 
**Coding.** The value is '1' if at least one of the above mentioned characteristics of an object referent causes differences in direct object marking. The value is '0' if case marking  depends entirely on the type of a noun (e.g., in Khanty, only pronouns take accusative marking). When answering the question, only finite clauses were considered.
