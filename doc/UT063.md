**Are there nonfinite forms that can be used both as participles and action nominalizations?**

Nonfinite forms can be found in various functions. This question asks whether it is possible that one and the same form appears both as a participle and as action nominalization (see 1a and 1b, respectively). For an overlap between the form functioning as a participle and as agentive nominalization, see UT064.

>a. *[mama-li̮s’ **vur-e̮m**] de̮re̮m me kos’al-i*<br/>
>mother-GEN2 sew-PTCP shirt 1SG tear-PST<br/>
>‘I’ve torn the shirt mother sewed.’<br/>

>b. *[mama-le̮n de̮re̮m **vur-e̮m**] meni̮m kažitс’-e̮*<br/>
>mother-GEN shirt sew-NMLZ 1SG.DAT like-PRS.3>br/>
>‘I like the way mother has sewn the shirt.’<br/>

**Coding.** The value is '1' if a nonfinite form can be used both as a participle and as an agentive nominalization without any additional morphology.
