**Do core adjectives agree with the subject noun in number in the predicative position?**

Most adjectives have two positions, i.e. they can be used attributively (e.g., *tall boy*) and predicatively (e.g., *the boy is tall*). When positioned after a noun, the adjective may be preceded by a copula but not necessarily; it is also possible that the morphological marking of adjectives in the two contexts differs (Hofherr 2010: 10; Schachter and Shopen 2007: 13). This question examines whether it is common for adjectives occurring in the predicative position to agree with the head noun in number, as in Hungarian (1) and Estonian (2). (Following Grambank, *core adjectives* are defined semantically as property concepts such as value, shape, age, dimension.)

(1) Hungarian<br/>
>*a   fiú-**k**   magas-**ak***<br/>
>DEF.ART  boy-PL.NOM  tall-PL.NOM<br/>
>‘The boys are tall’

(2) Estonian<br/>
>*poisi-**d**  on   pika-**d***<br/>
>boy-PL.NOM  be.3   tall-PL.NOM<br/>
>'The boys are tall'

**Coding.** The answer is '1' if it is common for core adjectives used predicatively to agree with the subject noun in number. The answer is '0' if there is no agreement.
