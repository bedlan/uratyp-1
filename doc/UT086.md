**Is there a locative case that expresses goal?**

A language may contain different local cases for encoding goal, location, and source (see also UT087 and UT088). This question asks whether there is a dedicated case to express goal (1).

**Coding.** The value is '1' if there is at least one such local case that is primarily used to express goal (in some languages there may be more than one local case to express goal). The answer is '0' if there is syncretism, e.g., the case used to express goal is also used to express location (see UT089).
