**Can locative adverbial phrases act as predicates without a copula?**

Locative predicates are a type of nonverbal predicates used to convey location (Dryer 2007). A locative predicate involves a locative adverbial phrase that usually is a noun (or a prepositional) phrase or a clause with locational meaning. The aim of this question is to find out whether locative predicates can commonly occur without a copula, as in example (1).

>(1) South Saami<br/>
>*Manne ålkone*<br/>
>I out<br/>
>'I am outside’

To compare, in Finnish it is not common to omit a copula in such cases:

>(2) Finnish<br/>
>*Minä ole-n ulkona*<br/>
>I be-1SG out<br/>
>‘I am outside.’

**Coding.** The value is '1' if locative adverbial phrases are commonly attested without a copula (usually a 'be'-verb), as in South Saami (1). In the case locative predicates typically require a copula, as in Finnish (2), the value is '0'.
