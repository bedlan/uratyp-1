**Is there morphological marking on the verb dedicated to the expression of deontic possibility?** 

Deontic possibility has to do with permission, e.g., *You may leave the hospital after a week*. This question asks, whether there is a morphological marker, which can be used to convey such a meaning. In Hungarian, the derivational suffix *-het/-hat* is used to give permission (1) (additionally it functions as a marker of epistemic possibility).

>‘you may come in’

**Coding.** The answer is '1' if there is a dedicated morphological marker used to grant permission. In case a language only makes use of lexical means, phonologically independent means (particles, auxiliaries), the value is '0'.
