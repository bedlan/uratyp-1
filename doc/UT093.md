**Is there a dedicated case that expresses the means by which something is carried out (instrumental) and/or accompaniment (comitative)?**

This question asks whether there is a case that primarily expresses an instrumental and/or comitative function. For example, the Estonian comitative case can be used for both functions (1a-b). In Komi Zyrian, in turn, there is a separate comitative case that is primarily found in the sociative function, typically with animate nouns, as shown in (2) (Kuznetsov 2022:493).

(1) Estonian<br/> 
>a. *lusikaga* (instrumental function)<br/>
>lusika-ga<br/>
>spoon-COM<br/>
>‘with a spoon’<br/>

>b. *lapsega* (comitative function)</br>
>lapse-ga<br/>
>child-COM<br/>
>‘with a child’</br>

(2) Komi Zyrian<br/>
>*мамыдкöд*<br/>
>mɑm-ɨd-kɘd<br/>
>mother-POSS.2SG-COM<br/>
>‘with your mother’<br/>

**Coding.** The value is '1', if there is a case that has at least one of the above mentioned functions as the primary function. The value is '0', if the comitative and/or instrumental meaning is a secondary function of another case.
