**Can a demonstrative stem be used as a pronoun with a 3Sg human referent?**

Personal pronouns are used to express the so-called grammatical persons in singular and plural (e.g. Estonian *mina* 'I' - 1st person singular, *sina* 'you' - 2nd person singular, *tema* 's/he' - 3rd person singular etc.). With respect to 3rd person pronouns, a language may have a distinct personal pronoun (such as Estonian *tema* 's/he') but a demonstrative stem may also be used in this function (see Bhat 2013 for different types of connections between 3rd person pronouns and demonstratives). For instance, in colloquial Estonian, *see* 'this/that/it' may be used with a 3rd person singular human referent, though often with a negative connotation.

>*Mida **see** ka teab sellest*<br/>
>mida see ka tea-b selle-st*<br/>
>what DEM also know-3SG DEM-ELA<br/>
>'What does s/he (lt. this one) know about this'

**Coding.** The value is '1' if a demonstrative stem may be used with a 3rd person human referent (even if it is only characteristic of colloquial language). The value is '0' if only a personal pronoun occurs in this function.
