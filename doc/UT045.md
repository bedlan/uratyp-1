**Is a copula commonly used for predicate nominals in the 3rd person singular forms of the present tense?**

Predicate nominal clauses typically express equation (*He is my father*) and proper inclusion (*He is a teacher*). The term *copula* designates a verb (e.g., *be* in example 1), an affix, or a particle that joins two nominal elements and functions as the predicate nucleus (Payne 1997: 115; Pustet 2003: 5). The aim of this question is to find out whether predicate nominal clauses typically follow the structure NP copula NP when used for the 3rd person singular and present time reference.

**Coding.** The value is '1' if copula is needed/commonly used in the simplest predicate nominal constructions, i.e. the present tense. When answering this question, only instances of 3Sg and present affirmative forms were considered; adjectives were not included within the category of ‘nominals’ here.
