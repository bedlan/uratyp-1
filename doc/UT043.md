**Can verbs in purposive subordinate clauses be in the bare infinitive form?**

A subordinate (or dependent) clause functions as a constituent of the main clause. Purposive clauses are a type of subordinate clauses used to express meanings like ‘in order to’, ‘so that’ etc. (1). Typically to adverbial clauses, purposive clauses function as adjuncts as they are not obligatory constituents of the clause. Here, we are only interested purposive clauses introduced by a complementizer, such as *et* in example (1). (The purposive clause may also be called *final clause*.)

>1SG go-1SG Hungary-ILL in_order Hungarian language-PRT study-INF<br/>
>'I’m going to Hungary in order to study Hungarian'<br/>

**Coding.** The value is '1' if it is possible to use a bare infinitive form (see 1) in the purposive subordinate clause. Only clauses introduced by a complementizer were considered.
