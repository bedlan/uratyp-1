**Can verbs in purposive subordinate clauses be bare infinitive forms?**

A subordinate (or dependent) clause functions as a constituent of the main clause. Purposive clauses are a type of subordinate clauses used to express meanings like ‘in order to’, ‘so that’ etc. (1). Purposive clauses function as adjuncts - typically o adverbial clauses - as they are not obligatory constituents of the clause. Here, we are only interested in purposive clauses introduced by a complementizer, such as *et* in example (1). (The purposive clause may also be called a *final clause*.)

>*Ma lähen Ungarisse, et ungari keelt **õppida***<br/>
>Ma lähe-n Ungari-sse, et ungari keel-t õppi-da<br/>
>1SG go-1SG Hungary-ILL in_order Hungarian language-PRT study-INF<br/>
>'I’m going to Hungary in order to study Hungarian'<br/>

**Coding.** The value is '1' if it is possible to use a bare infinitive form (see 1) in the purposive subordinate clause. Only clauses introduced by a complementizer were considered.
