**Are there morphological cases only used with pronouns?**

The same way that case inventories can vary in languages (from two to dozens), different words or word classes may display different number of cases, e.g., nouns may distinguish more cases than adjectives (Bickel and Nichols 2007: 210). The aim of this question is to find out whether pronouns stand out by displaying morphological cases not found with other word classes (e.g., with nouns or adjectives). For example, the accusative case in Finnish is only used with pronouns, cf. the case marking of *sinä* 'you' and *kirja* 'book' (1).

(1) Finnish<br/>
>*Minä halua-n sinu-**t** / kirja-n*<br/>
>1SG want-1SG you-ACC / book-GEN<br/>
>’I want you / the book’

**Coding.** The answer is '1' if pronouns display at least one morphological case not found with other word classes. If there are no such cases, the answer is '0'.
