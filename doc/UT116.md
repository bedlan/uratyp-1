**Is there contrastive length for consonants?**

If there is a phonological opposition between single consonants and geminate consonants in a language, the length of the consonant changes the word meaning, as in Finnish and Estonian. 

>Finnish<br/>
>kuka /ˈku.kɑ/ ‘who’ vs. kukka /ˈkuk.kɑ/ ‘flower’<br/>

>Estonian<br/>
>varas /ˈvɑ.rɑs/ 'thief' vs. varras /ˈvɑr.rɑs/ 'rod; stick'

**Coding.** The value is '1' if the meaning of the word depends on the length of the consonant.
