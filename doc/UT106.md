**Is there a human vs. non-human distinction in independent interrogative pronouns?**

This distinction means that a language uses one interrogative pronoun for humans and another for non-humans. For example, in Mansi, *xoonxa*/*xotjut* means ‘who’ and is used for humans, whereas *manõr* means ‘what’ and is used for animals and inanimate objects (Riese 2001).

**Coding.** The value is '1' if the language has an interrogative pronoun specifically for humans and another for non-humans. If the language instead exhibits an animacy distinction (i.e., animate vs. inanimate), the value is 0.
