**Can finite verbs agree in number with the nominal object?**

In addition to indexing the P argument on the verb, a language may also mark the number of the object, as in Tundra Nenets (1). This question maps languages, where such agreement is possible.

>(1) Tundra Nenets (Nikolaeva 2014:79)<br/>
>Objective conjugation, singuar object, 1SG: *meə-w°*<br/>
>Objective conjugation, dual obejct, 1SG: *meŋa-xəyu-n°*<br/> 
>Objective conjugation, plural object, 1SG: *me-yə-n°*<br/>
(*me*- ‘to take, to do’)

To compare, in Hungarian, irrespective of the number of the object the personal ending of 1Sg in definite conjugation is *-m* (example 2). Thus, Hungarian is coded as '0'.

> *El-olvas-t-am a könyv-et / a könyv-ek-et*<br/>
>PFX-read-PST-1SG.DEF DEF.ART book-ACC / DEF.ART book-PL-ACC<br/>
>'I read the book / the books'

**Coding.** The value is ‘1’ if there is a way to mark the number of the object on the main verb (as in Tundra Nenets). If no such distinction can be made, the value is '0' (as in Hungarian).
