**Can finite verbs agree in number with the nominal object?**

In addition to indexing the P argument on the verb, a language may also mark the number of the object, as in Tundra Nenets (1). This question maps languages, where such agreement is possible.

>1SG *meə-w°*, 2DU *me°-mih*, 1PL *me°-waq* (< *me*- ‘to take, to do’; the selection of a suffix depends on the number of the object)

**Coding.** The value is ‘1’ if there is a way to mark the number of the object on the main verb. If no such distinction can be made, the value is '0'. For instance, in Hungarian, irrespective of the number of the object the personal ending of 1Sg in definite declension is *-m*:
