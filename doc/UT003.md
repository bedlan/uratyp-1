**Can finite verbs agree in number with a nominal object?**

In addition to marking the P argument on the verb, a language may also encode the number of the object, as in Tundra Nenets (1a-b). This question maps languages, where such agreement is possible.

(1) Tundra Nenets<br/>
>a. *xadaə-da* (Nikolaeva 2014:80)<br/>
>kill-3SG>SG.OBJ<br/>
>‘He killed him/her’<br/>

>b. xadaŋa-xəyu-da (Nikolaeva 2014:80)<br/>
>kill-DU.OBJ-3SG<br/>
>‘He killed them two’<br/>

To compare, in Hungarian, irrespective of the number of the object the personal ending of 1Sg in definite conjugation is *-m* (2). Thus, Hungarian is coded as '0'.
 
>(2) Hungarian<br/>
> *El-olvas-t-am a könyv-et / a könyv-ek-et*<br/>
>PFX-read-PST-1SG.DEF DEF.ART book-ACC / DEF.ART book-PL-ACC<br/>
>'I read the book / the books'

**Coding.** The value is ‘1’ if there is a way to mark the number of the object on the main verb (as in Tundra Nenets). If no such distinction can be made, the value is '0' (as in Hungarian).
