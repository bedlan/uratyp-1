**Is OV the neutral order in affirmative imperative clauses?**

The aim of this question is to determine whether OV is the neutral order in affirmative imperative clauses, as in Udmurt (1).

(1) Udmurt<br/>
>*чай ю!<br/> 
>t͡ɕɑj ju*<br/>
>tea[ACC] drink.IMP.2SG<br/>
>'Drink tea!'<br/>
>(Nikolay Kuznetsov, p.c.)

**Coding.** The value is '1' only if OV represents the neutral order. If OV is possible but not neutral, the value is '0'.
