**Can the modifier of action nominalization in patient role (e.g. "drinking of coffee") be encoded like the direct object?**

The aim of the question is to find out whether the same encoding can be used for the modifier of action nominalization in the patient role and the direct object. In Estonian, the genitive encoding is possible in both occasions (see 1a and 1b). 

>(1) Estonian<br/> 
>a. ***luuletuse** kirjutamine*<br/> 
>poem.GEN writing<br/>
>'a poem writing'

>b. *kirjuta-n **luuletuse***<br/> 
>write-1SG poem.GEN
>'I'll write a poem'

**Coding.** The value is '1' if in both occasions one and the same case marking can be used (as in Estonian).
