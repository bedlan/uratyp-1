**Can the possessor in the attributive construction be encoded with the nominative?**

There are several ways to encode attributive possession. A marker may appear on the possessor and/or on the possessee, or the two elements may simply be juxtaposed. This question examines whether the possessor can occur in the nominative case, as in Hungarian (1) and Udmurt (2). In example (1), the possessee also carries a 3rd person possessive suffix, whereas example (2) illustrates simple juxtaposition.

(1) Hungarian (Rounds 2013)<br/>
>***Kornél**  kalap-ja*<br/>
>Kornél.NOM  hat-POSS.3SG<br/>
>‘Kornél’s hat’<br/>

(2) Udmurt (Edygarova 2009)<br/> 
>***val** jir*<br/> 
>horse.NOM head.NOM<br/> 
>’horse’s head’<br/> 

**Coding.** The value is ‘1’ if the possessor in an attributive construction can occur in the nominative case to express a central function of possession (e.g., physical possession, body-part or kinship relations). The value is ‘0’ if the nominative case is used only in limited or lexicalized instances.
