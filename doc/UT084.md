**Is there a separate case to indicate without what/who an action takes place / does not take place?**

This question asks whether there is a case indicating without what/who an action does or does not take place, as in Finnish (1). (The respective case is often called *abessive*.)

>(1) Finnish<br/>
>*Lähd-i-n töi-hin käsilauku-**tta**-ni*<br/>
>leave-PST-1SG work-ILL  handbag-ABE-POSS.1SG<br/>
>‘I left for work without my handbag.’

In order to suffice for a '1', such case marking has to be productive (not only occur with a limited set of words). 

**Coding.** The value is '1' only if there is a dedicated case marker and it is productive in a language.
