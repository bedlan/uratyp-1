**Is there a dedicated case that expresses the absence of a referent (abessive)?**

This question asks whether there is a case indicating without what/who an action does or does not take place, as in Finnish (1). The corresponding case is often called the *abessive*.

(1) Finnish<br/>
>*Lähdin töihin **käsilaukuttani***<br/>
>lähd-i-n töi-hin käsilauku-tta-ni<br/>
>leave-PST-1SG work-ILL  handbag-ABE-POSS.1SG<br/>
>‘I left for work without my handbag.’

**Coding.** The value is '1' only if there is a dedicated case marker. In order to suffice for a '1', such case marking has to be productive and not occur only with a limited set of words or in some fossilized forms.
