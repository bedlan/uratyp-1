**Are there palatalized alveolar consonants?**

In some languages, palatalized alveolar consonants (e.g., /tʲ lʲ nʲ/) contrast with plain alveolar consonants (non-palatalized alveolars) on the phonological level, i.e., the word’s meaning depends on the palatalization or non-palatalization of alveolar consonants.

**Coding.** The value is '1' if there is a phonological opposition between palatalized alveolar consonants (e.g., /tʲ lʲ nʲ/) and plain alveolar consonants (non-palatalized alveolars) in the core vocabulary.
