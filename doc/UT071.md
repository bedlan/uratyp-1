**Can modifiers of action nominalizations in agent and patient roles both be encoded like possessors?**

The aim of the question is to determine whether modifiers of action nominalizations can be encoded like possessors in agent and patient roles. The Estonian example (1a) contains an agent, while (1b) contains a patient. There are also examples where two interpretations are possible, e.g., in (1c) *poisi* can be understood as an agent or patient (depending on the context). In all examples (1a-c), genitive encoding appears, which is also used for possessors (cf. 1d).  

(1) Estonian<br/>
>a. ***minu** ütlemine* (S)<br/>
>minu ütle-mine<br/>
1SG.GEN say-NMLZ<br/>
'my saying'

>b. ***saapa** viskamine* (P)<br/>
>saapa viska-mine<br/>
>boot.GEN throw-NMLZ<br/>
'boot throwing'

>c. ***poisi** pesemine* (S/P)<br/>
>poisi pese-mine<br/>
>boy.GEN wash-NMLZ<br/>
>'washing of the boy (i.e. done by the boy)'/ 'washing the boy'

>d. ***poisi** tuba*<br/>
>boy.GEN room<br/>
>‘boy's room'

**Coding.** The value is '1' if possessors can be encoded in the same way as modifiers of action nominalizations in agent and patient roles. To be encoded as '1', it is at least necessary to have examples like (1a) and (1b). The value is '1' also if they are all zero-marked.
