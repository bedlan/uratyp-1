**Can modifiers of action nominalization in agent and patient roles both be encoded like possessors?**

The aim of the question is to find out whether modifiers of action nominalization can be encoded like possessors in agent and patient roles. Estonian example (1a) contains an agent, while (1b) contains a patient. There are also examples where two interpretations are possible, e.g., in (1c) *poisi* can be understood as an agent or patient (depending on the context). In all examples (1a-c), the genitive encoding appears, which is also used for possessors (cf. 1d).  

(1) Estonian<br/>
>a. ***minu** ütle-mine* (S)<br/>
1SG.GEN say-NMLZ<br/>
'my saying'

>b. ***saapa** viska-mine* (P)<br/>
>boot throw-NMLZ<br/>
'boot throwing'

>c. ***poisi** pese-mine* (S/P)<br/>
>boy.GEN wash-NMLZ<br/>
>'washing of the boy (i.e. done by the boy)'/ 'washing the boy'

>d. ***poisi** tuba*<br/>
>boy.GEN room<br/>
>‘boy's room'

**Coding.** The value is '1' if possessors can be encoded the same way as modifiers of action nominalizations in agent and patient roles. To be encoded as '1', at least examples like (1a) and (1b) are necessary. The value is '1' also in the case they are all zero-marked.
