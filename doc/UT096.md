**Is there a case that expresses the result of a change of state (translative), which is different from a case that expresses a state of being (essive) or ohter relations**

The aim of this question is to determine whether there is a separate case for expressing the result of a change of state (usually called the *translative*), distinct from the case typically used to mark a state of being (for an example of overlap, see UT095). In Finnish, for instance, these two meanings are encoded by different cases, called the  *translative* (1a) and *essive* (1b).

>a. *Hän opiskeli **opettajaksi***<br/>
>3SG opiskel-i opettaja-ksi<br/>
>s/he study.-PST.3SG teacher-TRA<br/>
>‘She studied to become a teacher'

>b. *Hän työskentelee **opettajana***<br/>
>hän työskentele-e opettaja-na<br/>
>3SG work-3SG teacher-ESS<br/>
>‘She works as a teacher’
 
**Coding.** The value is '1' if there is a separate case for expressing the result of a change of state (as in Finnish). The value is '0' if this meaning only emerges as a secondary function of another case.
