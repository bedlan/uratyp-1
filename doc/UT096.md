**Is there a case that expresses a state of being (essive), which is different from a case that expresses the result of a change of state (translative) or other relations?**

The aim of this question is to determine whether there is a separate case for expressing a state of being (usually called the *essive*), distinct from the case typically used to mark the result of a change of state (for an example of overlap, see UT095). In Finnish, for instance, these two meanings are encoded by different cases, called the *essive* (1a) and *translative* (1b).

>a. *Hän työskentelee **opettajana***<br/>
>hän työskentele-e opettaja-na<br/>
>3SG work-3SG teacher-ESS<br/>
>‘She works as a teacher’

>b. *Hän opiskeli **opettajaksi***<br/>
>3SG opiskel-i opettaja-ksi<br/>
>s/he study.-PST.3SG teacher-TRA<br/>
>‘She studied to become a teacher'
 
**Coding.** The value is '1' if there is a separate case for expressing a state of being (as in Finnish example 1a). The value is '0' if this meaning only emerges as a secondary function of another case.
