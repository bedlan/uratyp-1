**Is there morphological marking on the verb dedicated to the expression of apprehension?**

The apprehensive marker is used to express fear or regret about a certain situation; the state of affairs may be viewed as something undesirable. In Tundra Nenets, the apprehensive mood is used to convey fear about the future, in which case the apprehensive marker typically occurs on the negative auxiliary (see 1); a further meaning is regret about the past (see 2) (Nikolaeva 2014: 90-91).

**Coding.** The answer is '1' if there is a dedicated morphological marker used to express apprehension. In case a language only makes use of lexical means, phonologically independent means (particles, auxiliaries), the value is '0'.
