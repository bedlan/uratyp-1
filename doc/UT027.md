**Are verbs marked with a non-indicative mood in counterfactual conditional clauses?**

Counterfactuality may be defined as the “fictitious creation of a possible world which does not correspond to the actual world and therefore is “contrary to fact”" (Squartini 2019:64). Counterfactuality may be expressed in connection with past, present, and future. In all cases, the protasis is contrary to fact, false, or unlikely. This question investigates whether the verb of the protasis is marked with a specific mood (the terms *conditional*, *irrealis* may be used). For example, Finnish (1) and Nganasan (2) make use of conditional marking.  

(1) Finnish<br/>
>*Jos olisit leiponut kakun, söisin sen*<br/>
>Jos ol-isi-t leipo-nut kaku-n, sö-isi-n se-n<br/>
>if be-COND-2SG bake-ACT.PST.PTCP  cake-GEN eat-COND-1SG it-GEN<br/>
>’If you had baked a cake, I would eat it’

>(2) Nganasan<br/>
>*mɨŋ ŋəməɁkəsuə ihünüɁ ńaagəiɁ kuntubaaðəińüɁ* (Wagner-Nagy 2018)<br/> 
>mɨŋ ŋəmə-Ɂkə-suə i-hü-nüɁ ńaagəi-Ɂ kuntu-baaðəi-ńüɁ<br/> 
>we eat-RES-PST.[3SG] be-COND-OBL.1PLPOSS good-ADV sleep-IRR.RFL-1PL.RFL<br/>
>‘If we had eaten, we would have slept well’<br/>
>(Wagner-Nagy 2018) 

**Coding.** The value is '1' if in counterfactual conditional clauses verbs of the protasis (typically the 'if'-clause) are marked with a non-indicative mood.
