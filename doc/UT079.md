**Does the numeral modification of a noun have an effect on its case selection?** 

Both cardinal as well as ordinal numerals modify a noun phrase. Whereas cardinal numerals express the number of referents denoted by the noun (*three books*), ordinal numerals convey their order in relation to other referents (*the third book*). They may also differ in their underlying (morpho)syntax. (Dryer 2007: 164) This question asks whether there are morphosyntactic differences between noun phrases containing a cardinal numeral. For example, the numeral 'one' requires the nominative case in Finnish, whereas the cardinal numerals bigger than 'one' take the partitive (1).

(1) Finnish<br/>
>*yksi ystävä :  kaksi ystävää*<br/> 
>one.NOM.SG friend.NOM.SG :  two.NOM.SG friend.PRT.SG<br/>
>‘one friend' : 'two friends’

To compare, in Hungarian, the nominative case is used irrespective of the cardinal numeral. Thus, Hungarian is coded as '0'.

(2) Hungarian>br/>
>*egy ház : száz ház*<br/>
>one.NOM.SG house.NOM.SG : hundred.NOM.SG house.NOM.SG<br/>
>'one house' : 'hundred houses'

**Coding.** The value is '1' if a cardinal numeral can influence the case selection of a noun (as in Finnish example). The value is '0' if there are no changes in the case marking irrespective of the cardinal numeral used (see Hungarian example).
