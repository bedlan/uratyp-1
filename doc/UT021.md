**Is there a grammatical device for pluperfect?**

The pluperfect is used to locate a situation in the past prior to a reference point that is also in the past; thus, it can be regarded as 'past in the past' (Comrie 1985: 65). Whereas in example (1) the referece point is established by the subordinate clause, in example (2) it becomes clear from the context that an action was completed by a certain point in the past. Both periphrastic (1) as well as morphological means (2) suffice for '1'.

>'He had carried a dead body across my morther's way'

**Coding.** The value is '1' if there is a dedicated pluperfect device, either periphrastic or morphological.
