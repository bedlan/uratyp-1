**Is there grammatical marking of the pluperfect?**

The pluperfect is used to locate a situation in the past prior to a reference point that is also in the past; thus, it can be regarded as 'past in the past' (Comrie 1985: 65). Whereas in example (1) the referece point is established by the subordinate clause, example (2) shows that the reference time is not necessarily expressed in the same sentence. Both periphrastic (1) as well as morphological means (2) suffice for '1'.

>kui ma saabu-si-n, ol-i ta juba lahku-nud<br/>
>when 1SG arrive-PST-1SG be-PST.3SG 3SG already leave-ACT.PST.PTCP<br/>
>‘When I arrived, s/he had already left’

>*sɨtɨ bǝðürbüǝ ńemɨnǝ sǝd'ǝǝ-mǝnu **kontud'üǝd'ǝǝ***<br/>
>sɨtɨ bǝðürbüǝ ńemɨ-nǝ sǝd'ǝǝ-mǝnu kontu-d'üǝd'ǝǝ<br/>
>s/he dead.man.[ACC] mother-GEN.1SGPOSS way-PROL carry-PPF.[3SG]<br/>
>'He had carried a dead body across my mother's way'<br/>
>(Wagner-Nagy 2018)

**Coding.** The value is '1' if there is a dedicated pluperfect device, either periphrastic or morphological.
