**Can adpositions have person/number marking?**

Adpositions supplement the case system by providing extra ways of expressing temporal, spatial, and other types of relationship, e.g., in the Hungarian example (1a), *mellett* conveys a spatial relationship. Adpositions also share several characteristics with cases, for instance, they may be used as stems to which personal suffixes are attached. This question examines weather person/number marking is possible on words that are also used as adpositions (see 1b). 
 
(1) Hungarian<br/>
>a. *a múzeum mellett* 
> DEF.ART museum next
>'next to the museum'<br/>

>b. ***mellettem** : **melletted***, etc.<br/>
>mellette-m : mellette-d<br/>
>next-POSS.1SG : next-POSS.2SG<br/>
> 'next to me, you, etc.'<br/>

**Coding.** The answer is '1' if person/number markers can be attached to what also occur s adpositional stems. If this is not possible, the answer is '0'.
