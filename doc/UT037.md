**Can non-singular 2nd and 3rd person have the same person/number marking or morphosyntactic treatment?**

In the case of syncretism, a single form is used to express two or more functions within the inflectional paradigm. This question aims to capture syncretism in non-singular 2nd and 3rd person forms. In Livonian, for instance, there is syncretism in the past tense forms (1), whereas in Tundra Nenets syncretism involves present tense forms of the objective conjugation in dual (2).

>(1) Livonian<br/>
>*jel-īz-**tõ***<br/> 
>live-PST-2PL/3PL<br/> 
>‘you/they lived’

>(2) Tundra Nenets (Nikoleaeva 2014: 79)<br/> 
>*meŋa-xəyu-**d′ih***<br/>
>take-DU.OBJ-2DU/3DU<br/>
>‘you two/they two take (sth)’<br/>

**Coding.** The value is '1' if non-singular 2nd and 3rd person can be marked the same way, which makes them different (at least) from the non-singular 1st person.
