**Are there participles that can encode their subject with possessive suffixes?**

In Finnish, the possessive marking may be used to encode the subject of the situation (1-2) (Shagal 2018; Hakulinen et al. 2004: § 527). To compare, in respective finite clauses, the subject is expressed with the nominative. The Finnish agentive participle and passive participle (2) are employed only for direct object relativization.

(1) Finnish<br/>
>*teke-**mä-ni** työ*<br/>
>do-AG.PTCP-POSS.1SG work<br/>
>‘Work that I did’<br/>

(2) Finnish<br/>
>*Kuva-tta-va-kse-ni tilhi ei antaudu.*  (Hakulinen et al. 2004: § 533)<br/>
>photograph-PASS-PRS.PTCP-TRNSL-POSS.1SG waxwing NEG surrender<br/>
>’The waxwing won't let me photograph it’<br/>

**Coding.** The value is '1' if a possessive suffix encoding the subject can attach to a participle. The value is '0' in the case there are no possessive suffixes in a language or they occur in some other position (e.g., on the head noun).
