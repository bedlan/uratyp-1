**Does the marking of the object depend on the verb conjugation form?**

The marking of the object may depend on a verb form (see also UT010 and UT011). For instance, in Estonian, the imperative verb form takes an object in the nominative case (1a) and the negative verb form requires an object in the partitive case (1b). 

>(1) Estonian<br/>
>a. *Võta         **võti**!*<br/>
>   take.IMP.2SG  key.NOM<br/>
>   ‘Take the key’

>b. *Ära          võta      **võti-t**!*<br/>
>   NEG.IMP.2SG   take.CNG  key-PRT<br/>
>   ‘Don’t take the key!’

**Coding.** The value is '1' if the verb conjugation form can have an effect on the case selection of the object (as in Estonian). When answering the question, only finite forms were considered; object conjugation was not considered.
