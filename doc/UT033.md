**Is it common to use the imperative/jussive in complement clauses introduced by predicates expressing wish/desire/will?** 

Complement clauses introduced by verbs of different semantic types (e.g., 'want', 'order', 'see' etc.) may require a specific marking on the verb in the complement clause. The aim of this question is to find out whether imperative/jussive marking occurs in complement clauses introduced by verbs conveying 'wish', 'want', or related meanings (see example 1). (Instead of *imperative* or *jussive* the terms *subjunctive* or *conjunctive* may also be used.)

**Coding.** The value is '1' if imperative/jussive marking can appear on the verb in the complement clause introduced by predicates expressing wish, desire, or will.
