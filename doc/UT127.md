**Is there non-initial primary stress?**

Primary stress can fall on non-initial syllables for several reasons: (i) the primary stress is fixed on a non-initial syllable of a word (e.g., in Udmurt); (ii) the primary stress is dependent on the syllable structure (e.g., in Meadow Mari the heavy syllables); (iii) the location of stress is free.

>Udmurt<br/>
>нунал /nu.ˈnɑl/ ‘day’

>Meadow Mari<br/>
>кокырыкˈташ /kokərəkˈtɑʃ/ ‘make someone cough’

**Coding.** The value is '1' if there is a non-initial primary stress. When answering the question, only the core vocabulary of the language was considered.
