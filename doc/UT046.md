**Is a copula needed for predicate nominals in the past and/or future tense?**

Predicate nominals typically involve the structure NP copula NP, where *copula* usually designates a verb, but it may also be an affix, or a particle that joins two nominal elements (Payne 1997: 115; Pustet 2003: 5). This question asks whether a copula is commonly used in semantically marked occasions, such as in the past tense, as in example (1) (for clauses with present time reference, see UT045).

>‘This was his daugther’s husband’

**Coding.** The value is '1' if a copula is commonly used in clauses with past time reference. When answering this question only affirmative past tense forms were considered.
