**Are clauses with only infinitive predicates possible?**

A clause minimally consists of one predicate; the number of arguments depends on the predicate. The aim of this question is to find out whether an infinitive form can appear as the only predicate in an independent clause. This is possible in Estonian, where an infinitive can be used to express evidential meaning (1). In North Saami example (2) an infinitive is used to give an order. 

>(1) Estonian<br/>
>*Ta **olla** kodus*<br/>
>*Ta ol-la kodu-s*<br/>
>s/he be-INF home-INE<br/>
>'S/he is said to be at home'<br/>

>(2) North Saami<br/>
>*Ii **doarrut**!*<br/>
>*Ii doarru-t!*<br/>
>NEG.3SG quarrel-INF<br/>
>'Do not quarrel!'<br/>

**Coding.** The value is '1' if an infinitive can be used in an independent clause (main clause) to form a predicate. The value is '0' if there are no such examples or an infinitive only appears as a result of dropping an auxiliary. (Although infinitives together with participles and converbs can be regarded as non-finite forms, this question only targets infinitives.)
