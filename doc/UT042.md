**Are clauses with only infinitive predicates possible?**

This question asks whether an infinitival verb form can appear as the only predicate in the clause with a directive function (example 1).

The addressee of a directive expressed with an infinitive is an impersonal or implicit referent. Infinitive directives can have several specific functions in discourse: they are used, e.g., as generic instructions, strong commands, curt commands, proscriptions, instructions. (Aikhenvald 2010: 281-283)

**Coding.** The value is '1' if an infinitive can be used in an independent clause (main clause) with a directive function. The value is '0' if there are no such examples or an infinitive only appears as a result of dropping an auxiliary. (Although infinitives together with participles and converbs can be regarded as non-finite forms, this question only targets infinitives.)
