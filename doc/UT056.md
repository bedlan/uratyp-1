**Are there nonfinite forms that can relativize at least all core participants (S/A/P) and possibly also some noncore participants, e.g. locative adverbials, instruments, etc.?**

A participle may be used to relativize only one specific participant of the situation (i.e. only S/A, P or S/P; see UT055), but there are also participles that can relativize all core participants as well as some noncore participants (Shagal 2017: 1-3). To exemplify, Hill Mari *-šašlə̑k* (see example 1) cannot relativize any particular participant but it can be used in a wide variety of contexts including in relativization of locatives (Shagal 2018).

(1) Hill Mari (Shagal 2018: 57)<br/>
>*[Vas’a(-n) ə̈lə̈-šäšlə̑k] pört-ə̈m mə̈n’ stroj-en-äm*<br/>
>Vasya(-GEN) live-PTCP.DEB house-ACC 1SG[NOM] build-PRF-1SG<br/>
>‘I built the house in which Vasya will live’

In some languages, the relevant forms may be referred to as nominalizations or converbs. 

**Coding.** The value is '1' if a language contains at least one such participle that can relativize all noncore participants and possibly also some noncore participants.
