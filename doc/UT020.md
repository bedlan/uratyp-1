**Is there a grammatical device for immediate future?**

A language may contain more than one means to express future time reference. There may also be a separate device for expressing immediate future (Bybee et al. 1994). In the case of immediate future, a situation can be viewed as about to take place. Whereas in Nganasan, there is a resultative inflection (1), in Estonian, a periphrastic device may be used (2).

**Coding.** The value is '1' if there is a grammatical device (either inflectional or periphrastic), which can be used to express an action that is about to happen (regardless of other possible functions the device may have). Instances of a lexical verb used in the past tense form to convey an immediate activity were not counted (e.g., Estonian *Läksime!* go.PST.1PL ‘Off we go!’, cf. Russian *пошли*).
