**Is there a contrastive length of vowels?**

If there is a phonological opposition between short and long vowels in a language, the length of vowels changes the word meaning (see Finnish example). To compare, in Central Veps, a single vowel may sound long (e.g., _suŕ_ ’big’), but there is no phonological contrast.

>tuli /ˈtu.li/ ‘fire’ vs. tuuli /ˈtuː.li/ ‘wind’

**Coding.** The value is '1' if the meaning of the word depends on the vowel length.
