**Can an adnominal property word agree with the noun in case?**

This question asks whether adnominal property words can take the same case form as the nouns they modify (see example 1). The *adnominal property word* roughly corresponds to the term *adjective*.

> (1) Estonian<br/>
>*vana-s maja-s*<br/>
>old-INE  house-INE<br/> 
>‘in an old house’

**Coding.** The value is '1' if agreement is possible in at least some parts of the case paradigm, if not, the value is '0' (see also UT005). Adjectivized participial forms were not considered when answering this question.
