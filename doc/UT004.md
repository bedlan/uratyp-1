**Can an adnominal property word agree with the noun in case?**

This question asks whether the adnominal property word can take the same case form as the head noun (see example 1). Property words roughly correspond to adjectives.

>*vanas majas*<br/>
>vana-s maja-s<br/>
>old-INE  house-INE<br/> 
>‘in an old house’

**Coding.** The value is '1' if agreement is possible in at least some parts of the case paradigm, if not, the value is '0' (see also UT005). Adjectivized participial forms were not considered when answering this question.
