**Is there morphological marking for irrealis (e.g. hypothetical state of affairs)?**

It is possible to distinguish between events that have actualised (*realis*) and events that can only be imagined or wished for (*irrealis*) (Mithun 1995). This question asks whether morphological marking is used to encode events regarded as nonactualised; see conditional marking used in example (1). (Various terms may be used, e.g., *conditional*, *conjunctive*, *subjunctive*.)

**Coding.** The value is '1' if morphological marking is used to denote events regarded as nonactualised. Thus, instances where irrealis is only expressed by phonologically independent means (e.g., particles, auxiliaries) count as '0'. <br/>
