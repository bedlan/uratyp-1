**Is there morphological marking on the verb dedicated to irrealis?**

It is possible to distinguish between events that have actualised (*realis*) and events that can only be imagined or wished for (*irrealis*) (Mithun 1995). This question asks whether morphological marking is used to encode events regarded as nonactualised; see conditional marking used in example (1). (Various terms may be used, e.g., *conditional*, *conjunctive*, *subjunctive*.)

>'I would live in the countryside if I could' 

**Coding.** The value is '1' if morphological marking is used to denote events regarded as nonactualised. In order to suffice for ‘1’ morphological marking has to be available at least for some lexical verbs. Thus, instances where irrealis is only expressed by phonologically independent means (such as particles or auxiliaries) count as '0'. <br/>
