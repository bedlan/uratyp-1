**Are there cases that do not show agreement in terms of case?**

Adjectives used as adnominal modifiers may share some but not necessarily all categories with their head nouns. For instance, in Veps, the comitative head noun is preceded by an adnominal property word in the genitive form (example 1). While Veps shows non-agreement only in some parts of the paradigm, there are languages like Mari (see example 2) that show no agreement between a modifier and the head noun whatsoever.

>(1) Veps (Grünthal 2015:16)<br/>
>*pene-n mužika-nke* <br/>
>short-GEN man-COM<br/> 
>‘with a short man’ 

>(2) Meadow Mari (Riese et al. 2019)<br/>
>*сылне сӱрет-лан*<br/>
>beautiful picture-DAT<br/>
>'to the beautiful picture'

**Coding.** The value is '1' in both cases, i.e., when non-agreement is attested only in some parts of the paradigm as well as when there is no agreement within noun phrases at all. The value is '0' if agreement across the paradigm is obligatory.
