**Is there a distinct category of dual for verbal agreement with a dual subject?**

Dual is a grammatical number category that refers to two entities. This question asks whether there is agreement, i.e. dual is also marked on the verb, as in South Saami example (1).

>(1) South Saami<br/>
>*Månnoeh luhkien*<br/>
>we.1DU read.1DU<br/>
>‘We two read'

Agreement may be consistent for various kinds of nouns (e.g., animate and inanimate nouns) and pronouns. In South Saami, there is dual agreement only with pronouns. In other instances, the plural form is used (cf. examples 2-3).<br/>

>(2) South Saami<br/>
>*Maanah låhkijägan*<br/>
>child.PL read.3DU<br/>
>‘Children read’ (= two or more)

>(3) South Saami<br/>
>*Göökte  gaahtoeh  byöpmedieh*<br/> 
>two      cat.PL    eat.3PL<br/>
>‘Two cats eat'

**Coding.** The value is ‘1’ if there is verbal agreement with dual subject in at least one of the possibilities mentioned above. The answer is ‘0’ if dual is marked only on the verb or only on the noun.</p>
