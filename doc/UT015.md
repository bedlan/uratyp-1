**Can S and P be conflated morphologically across clause boundaries, i.e. act as syntactic pivot?**

Apart from languages where S and A can be conflated across clause boundaries (cf. UT014) there are also languages that can combine S (= subject in the intransitive sentence) and P (= object in the transitive sentence), which implies an 'ergative' pivot (see Aikhenvald 2015:258). East Mansi reveals such a possibility:

(1) East Mansi<br/>
>***tolmax** (**A**) nee-m (**P**) senktǝ-stǝ, (**Ø**) il xajtǝs*<br/>
>thief woman-ACC hit-PST.SG>3SG away run-PST.3SG<br/>
>'The thief hit the woman, and she ran away'

**Coding.** The value is '1' if S and P can be conflated (as in East Mansi). The value is '0' if the shared argument that is omitted functions as S or A (cf. UT014).
