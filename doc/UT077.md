**Is case compounding possible?**

Case compounding is usually understood as attachment of multiple inflectional case markers to a noun stem that make up a phonological word. The phenomenon is also known as Suffixaufnahme (see Plank 1995). Several types of case compounding can be attested. The Udmurt example (1) is an instance of a simple headless adnominal, which additionally includes a case for the elided head. In Komi, it is possible that several spatial cases are combined to form a complex spatial case (Arkhangelskiy and Usacheva 2019:115).

(1) Udmurt<br/>
>*gurtlenezlen*<br/>
>gurt-len-ez-len<br/>
>village-GEN-POSS.3SG-GEN<br/>
>‘of the one that belongs to the vilage’
>(Arkhangelskiy and Usacheva 2019:112)

**Coding.** The value is '1' if at least two case markers can be attached to the noun stem. The prerequisite is that the examples contain proper case endings.
