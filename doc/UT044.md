**Are there sentences without overt verbal arguments (e.g. weather verbs)?**

There may be verbs that do not require any verbal arguments (such as a subject or an object) but can form sentences on their own. This is often attested with the so-called meteorological or weather verbs, as in examples (1-2).

>*Sataa*<br/> 
>rain.3SG<br/>
>'It is raining'

>*Tjåetskeme*<br/> 
>cold_weather.NMLZ<br/> 
>‘It is cold’

**Coding.** The value is '1' if there are avalent verbs, i.e. verbs that do not need any arguments. The value is '0' if it is necessary to use a subject, including a dummy subject or expletive subject (such as *it* in the translations above).
