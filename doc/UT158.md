**Is there a constraint on word-initial alveolar trill /r/?**

There can be a constraint on word-initial /r/. For example, in Udmurt, word-initial /r/ is not allowed for phonotactic reasons and is replaced with a voiced affricate.

>Udmurt<br/>
>ӟуч /d͡ʑut͡ɕ/ ‘Russian’ 

To compare, in Komi, which is a close cognate language, word-initial /r/ is allowed: роч /rot͡ɕ/ ‘Russian’.

**Coding.** The value is '1' if there is a constraint on word-initial /r/.
