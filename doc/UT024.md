**Is there grammatical marking of mirativity?**

Mirativity is a grammatical category used to denote new, unexpected, and/or surprising situations. Although mirativity may be viewed as a subcategory of evidentiality (inferentiality) since it often arises as an extension of evidentiality, there are also reasons to view it in its own right: (i) an unexpected situation is not necessarily inferred; (ii) it may emerge as an extension of tense or mood (OUDB). Mirativity is regarded as a separate category in North Mansi (example 1), where it is shown to have evolved through desubordination (see Skribnik 2005). In Khanty dialects, the categories of evidentiality and mirativity reveal different origins (Nikolaeva 1999).

**Coding.** The value is '1' if there is a dedicated marker to denote new, unexpected, and/or surprising situations. Both morphological and periphrastic means count.
