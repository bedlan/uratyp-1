**Is there a case that expresses the means by which something is carried out (instrumental), which is different from a case that expresses accompaniment (comitative) or ohter relations?**

The aim of this question is to determine whether there are distinct means of expressing accompaniment ("in the company of") and the instrumental function ("using, by means of") (cf. UT093). For example, in Komi Zyrian, there is a separate comitative case (1a) and a separate instrumental case (1b) (Kuznetsov 2022:492-493).

(1) Komi-Zyrian<br/>
>a. *мамыдкöд* (comitative)<br/>
>mɑm-ɨd-kɘd<br/> 
>mother-POSS.2SG-COM<br/>
>'with your mother’(comitative)

>b. *паньöн* (instrumental)<br/>
>*pɑɲ-ɘn<br/> 
>spoon-INS<br/> 
>‘with a spoon’

**Coding.** The value is '1', if there is a separate case denoting the instrumental function. The value is '0', if the instrumental meaning is a secondary meaning of another case, such as a locative case.
