**When used as a relative pronoun, is it common to use 'who' for inanimates?**

Relative clauses may be introduced by a pronoun. This question asks whether there is an interrogative pronoun such as ‘who’ that, in addition to expressing animates, can also function as a relative pronoun referring to inanimates. For instance, the South Estonian *kiä* (1) can be used in this function.

(1) South Estonian (Seto)<br/>
>*kivi man om kistavars´, **kiä** kivvi .ümbre aas*<br/>
>mill at be.3SG lever who millstone.PRT around whirl.3SG<br/>
>’At the mill there is a lever that makes the millstone whirl’ 

**Coding.** The value is ‘1’ if the interrogative pronoun ‘who’ also functions as a relative pronoun and can be used with inanimates. The value is ‘0’ if this pronoun cannot be used in that way or if a different pronoun is used instead.
