>a. *a'ili-**ji***<br/>
>run-AG.NMLZ<br/> 
>'a runner'<br/>

>b. *a'ili-**ji** i'bbi*<br/> 
>run-AG.NMLZ horse.NOM<br/> 
>‘a running horse’ (lit. ‘a runner horse’)<br/>

For the overlap between a participle and action nominalization, see UT063. 

**Coding.** The value is '1' if a non-finite form can be used both as a participle and agentive nominalization without any additional morphology.
