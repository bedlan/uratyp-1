**Is there morphological marking on the verb dedicated to the expression of deontic necessity?**

Deontic necessity can be associated with the expression of obligation, the source of which is the speaker or another source (some authority). In Tundra Nenets, debitive is one of the several moods used to express obligation (1).

>(1) mənʹ° sʹit° xada-wənta-d°m<br/>
>I you.ACC kill-DEB-1SG<br/>
>‘I must kill you.’

**Coding.** The value is '1' if there is a dedicated morphological marker used to express deontic necessity. The answer is '0' if necessity can only be conveyed using lexical means, analytical constructions or particles.
