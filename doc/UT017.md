**Is there a grammatical device for frequentative?**

The frequentative is used to describe a situation (event or a state of affairs) as frequent. The aim of this question is to find out whether frequentativity can be expressed by means other than lexical ones. Both in North Mansi (1) and Hungarian (2), a derivational suffix is used to convey frequentativity.

>*suns-* vs. *suns-**iyl**-*<br/>
>'to watch' vs. 'to watch repeatedly'<br/>

>(2) Hungarian <br/>
>*olvas* vs. *olvas-**gat***<br/> 
>'to read' vs. 'to read repeatedly'

**Coding.** The value is '1' if the expression of frequentativity can be clearly attributed to a grammatical device. If only lexical means are available in a language, the answer is '0'.
