**Can second person singular verb forms be used in generic meaning?**

Canonical function of the 2nd person singular forms is to refer to the addressee. However, they may also receive generic interpretation when used without any specific 2nd person addressee is mind. There are instances that are unambiguously generic as otherwise the interpretation would literally be wrong, while other sentences allow for several interpretations (Gast et al. 2015: 148-149). Although without broader context the Veps example (1) could be directed to the addressee, the 2Sg forms are also attested in the generic function (see Grünthal 2015: 125). 

>(1) Veps (Grünthal 2015: 125)<br/>
>*Olude-spai  humalstu-**d***<br/>
>beer-ELA get_drunk-2SG<br/>
>'One gets drunk from beer’

**Coding.** The value is '1' if 2Sg forms are commonly found to express generic meaning in a language. In the case 2Sg forms are possible but rare the value is '0'
